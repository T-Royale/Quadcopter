Hi, this is my lastest repo to date and, as you have allready read in the title, I am making a drone using ARDUINO-based boards.
I am going to use 3d printing for the structure of the drone, four brushless motors, one TIP122 transistor for each motor and of course, an ARDUINO NANO.
You can use any normal infrared remote and a KY-022 receiver (take a look at my IR-LED repo) to control it but I am making my own radio remote with another NANO board and a few buttons.

This project isn't done yet so i'll be updating it over time
